# House-Pricing-Prediction
This project predicts house prices based on different features like location, size, and the number of rooms. The goal is to build machine learning models that help estimate house prices accurately.

What I Did in This Project
Step 1: Load and Explore the Data
I started by loading the dataset and understanding what features it contains.

Step 2: Clean and Preprocess the Data
I handled missing values, removed outliers, and encoded categorical variables so the models could understand the data better.

Step 3: Visualize the Data
I used different types of graphs to find patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (house price).

Step 4: Train Regression Models
I built several models to predict house prices, including:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Step 5: Evaluate the Models
I checked how well the models performed using metrics like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared (RÂ²)

Step 6: Interpret the Results
Finally, I analyzed which features had the most impact on house prices.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
